## The Big Mac index
The Big Mac Index is a price index published since 1986 by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and providing a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. 

## Source data
Big Mac prices are from McDonaldâ€™s directly and from reporting around the world; exchange rates are from Thomson Reuters (until January 2022) and Refinitiv Datastream (July 2022 on);The data I am using here has been preliminarily collated by [The Economist](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data.git), who collate the specific currency exchange rates of different countries each year into their data.
